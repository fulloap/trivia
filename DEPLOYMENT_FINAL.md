# âœ… Deployment Ready - Coolify Production

## Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT ðŸš€

All build and deployment issues have been resolved. The application is ready for production deployment on Coolify.

## Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Build Script**: Uses `npx` commands for vite and esbuild
2. **Vite Dependencies**: Completely eliminated from production bundle
3. **Logging**: Fixed undefined log function errors
4. **Static Files**: Proper serving from dist/public in production
5. **Health Checks**: Working curl endpoints in container

## Deployment Instructions:

### 1. Environment Variables (Coolify)
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:hIJWL0kFomqH24jZ17CmV1OfacXyHhnd4idNwY7tyEhi2yWr4eXDtvGAnZlq2N9A@qcggssww444k4wc48kww8844:5432/postgres
SESSION_SECRET=eb85b8d7a3c106ba3cfb6b9d8f3565a26c07530489728899ec9bc7a6bc855624a54d8690a2b97c145a4991cfc0224965fe2a56c3224f5702c1880ed181dd19ef
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3005
```

### 2. After Deployment
```bash
# Run migration to populate database
docker exec -it <container-name> npx tsx scripts/migrate-on-server.ts

# Verify health
curl http://your-domain:3005/api/health
```

## Build Process (Automated in Docker):
1. `npx vite build` â†’ Client assets to dist/public/
2. `npx esbuild` â†’ Server bundle to dist/index.js (no vite deps)
3. Copy production.ts â†’ dist/production.js
4. Patch imports in bundle

## Production Features:
- âœ… Zero vite dependencies in runtime
- âœ… Optimized multi-stage Docker build
- âœ… Health checks with curl
- âœ… Non-root container execution
- âœ… Proper logging in production
- âœ… Static file serving from dist/public

## Database Content:
- 3,000 authentic cultural questions (1,500 Cuba + 1,500 Honduras)
- Complete user system with referral tracking
- Global and country-specific rankings
- All question content based on 2024 cultural research

Ready to deploy! ðŸŽ‰
